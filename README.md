# fxTwitter bot

Just a quick implementation of [fxtwitter](https://github.com/robinuniverse/twitfix) as a Discord bot.

## Installation

Use the package manager `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
yarn/npm install 
```

Create a `.env` file with your discord bot token. You'll need to create one at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers).
Use `.env.example` as a template.

## Usage

Just run the program with node.

```bash
yarn/npm start 
```

To start in development.

```
